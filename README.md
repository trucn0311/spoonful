Modern Recipe Web App allows users to search and bookmark thousands of recipes. Each recipe is rendered with helpful details such as portion, cooking time, ingredients and the external link to the offical website. 
This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as Webpack to bundle the modules, and Babel to convert ES6, ES7 and ES8 back to ES5.
